# HOW TO TRADE IN STARFOREX

## It Is Really Simple

Before buying world currencies first you have to create a trustline to the asset being exchanged in your wallet. The account issuer for all assets is **GBANKIPYLOQ22HODF7RSQXB6Y3X46USJPSEFTOISSNQZPU6EKCRKACYU** and the home domain is starforex.co if you want to search for available assets

In order to buy currencies just scan the QR-code using your wallet, a payment operation will be created to send the XLM amount you wish to spend to the following bank address **GBANK5M4FONHN2PLMVDWFJOW7QQCN4YSLDHD5ZL6AOL3ZG2ELSRUJB47** The currency code you wish to buy goes in the memo field, the bots will autommatically fill the order at the current price and send the currencies right back to your wallet

Once the assets are in your wallet you can buy products from all countries, send them to other wallets or sell them in any of the Stellar Decentralized Exchanges available, no chargebacks, no limits, worldwide, in just seconds. That's the beauty of a digital bank truly designed for modern times
